# Boston_Housing_Linear_Regression

This notebook ML project is for exploring how autofeat can be used to improve a simple linear regression model.

autofeat can use the existing features and data to automatically engineer new features and select the probable best set.

This powerful tool can be used to quickly explore new features and lead to improvements on a mediocre performing model.

Additionally, the Boston Housing dataset allows for an important discussion about ethical AI. It has data that is racially biased and needs to be excluded from use.
By understanding, what data to keep and why, data scientists can make models that improve society rather than continue or increase disparity.
